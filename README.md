High inventory holding costs and frequent stockouts were impacting supply chain efficiency across 12 regions with 10,000+ SKUs.

## Solution Approach
- Analyzed historical sales data to calculate demand patterns and variability.
- Used Python (Pandas) scripts to compute reorder points and lead time demand for each SKU.
- Developed an Excel-based forecasting dashboard to visualize stock needs and optimize reorder quantities.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Microsoft Excel (Dashboard with formulas and charts)

## Repository Structure
- `data/` - Contains sample historical sales dataset (synthetic for confidentiality)
- `python_scripts/` - Python code for demand calculation and reorder point analysis
- `excel_dashboard/` - Excel workbook dashboard for inventory forecasting
- `results/` - Output CSV files with reorder points per SKU
- `images/` - Screenshots of Excel dashboard

## Key Outcomes
- Reduced stockouts by 23%
- Saved approximately â‚¹3,00,000 per month in holding costs
- Enabled data-driven inventory decisions across cross-functional teams

## How to Run
1. Use the `python_scripts/reorder_point_calculation.py` script to process sales data and calculate reorder points.
2. Load results into Excel dashboard for visualization and forecasting.
3. Adjust parameters as needed for lead times and safety stock.
